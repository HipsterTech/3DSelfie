## ht_icp_check 

A tool meant to provide quick visualization of the outcome of ICP between two point clouds. To see an example, run 
```
$ ht_icp_check  3DSelfie/data/suzanne_monkey_left_high.ply 3DSelfie/data/suzanne_monkey_right_high.ply 
```
watch magic happen... really slowly.

### TODOs

- [ ] Implement proper command line parsing (Unix style)
- [ ] Print all info in the GUI
